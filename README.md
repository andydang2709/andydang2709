## 👋 Hi, I’m Andy

I’m a **Business Intelligence–focused data analyst** who sits at the intersection of **business strategy and analytics**.

I turn messy data into clear insights, scalable dashboards, and decisions leaders actually use. From building **AWS-powered data pipelines at Amazon** to translating analytics into **executive-ready recommendations**, I care less about flashy models and more about **impact, clarity, and action**.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: **Recommender System**

- 💬 Ask me about: **AWS-Powered Chatbots**

- 📫 Feel free to email me at: **andykhangdang@gmail.com**
